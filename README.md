## Overview

This repository implements a **privacy-preserving giftcard system** using zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-SNARKs). The protocol allows users to:

- Deposit funds into privacy-preserving giftcard commitments
- Make partial withdrawals without revealing the total balance
- Prevent double-spending through cryptographic nullifiers
- Generate ephemeral recipient addresses for each withdrawal
- Prove membership in a Merkle tree without revealing position

All while maintaining complete privacy and cryptographic security through Groth16 proofs.

## GiftCardMerkle Circuit

The core of this system is the `GiftCardMerkle` circuit (circuits/giftcard_merkle.circom:1), a depth-32 Merkle tree-based privacy protocol that enables private giftcard withdrawals with spending constraints.

### Circuit Architecture

**Private Inputs:**
- `secret`: User's secret value (never revealed)
- `salt`: Randomization factor for commitment hiding
- `amountDeposited`: Total giftcard balance
- `amountRequested`: Current withdrawal amount
- `spentBefore`: Previously spent amount
- `ephemeralPrivKey`: BabyJubJub private key for one-time recipient address
- `pathElements[32]` / `pathIndices[32]`: Merkle proof of inclusion

**Public Outputs:**
- `root`: Merkle tree root (validates membership)
- `nullifierCurrent`: Unique nullifier `Poseidon(secret, amountRequested)` to prevent double-spending
- `amount`: Withdrawal amount (public for verification)
- `leafCommitment`: Giftcard commitment `Poseidon(secret, salt, amountDeposited)`
- `spentBefore_pub` / `spentAfter_pub` / `amountDeposited_pub`: Spending tracking
- `ephPubKeyX` / `ephPubKeyY`: BabyJubJub public key for ephemeral recipient

### Protocol Flow

1. **Deposit Phase**: User creates commitment `leafCommitment = Poseidon(secret, salt, amountDeposited)` and inserts into Merkle tree
2. **Withdrawal Phase**: User generates ZK proof with:
   - Merkle path proving commitment exists in tree
   - Spending constraint verification: `spentBefore + amountRequested <= amountDeposited`
   - Nullifier generation to prevent re-use
   - Ephemeral public key derivation for withdrawal address
3. **Verification**: Smart contract verifies proof and checks nullifier hasn't been used

### Cryptographic Components

- **Poseidon Hash**: ZK-friendly hash function for commitments, nullifiers, and Merkle tree (circuits/giftcard_merkle.circom:94,119,151)
- **BabyJubJub**: Elliptic curve for ephemeral key generation (circuits/giftcard_merkle.circom:76)
- **Merkle Tree**: Depth-32 tree with Poseidon hashing for commitment set anonymity (circuits/giftcard_merkle.circom:125)
- **Spending Constraint**: Enforced via `LessThan(128)` comparator ensuring `spentAfter <= amountDeposited` (circuits/giftcard_merkle.circom:111)

## Trusted Setup Ceremony

## How to Contribute to the Ceremony

Anyone can strengthen the ceremony by contributing random entropy. Only one honest participant is needed to ensure the final proving key is secure.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v16.0.0 or higher
- **snarkjs**: `npm install -g snarkjs`

### Contribution Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/lambda-zk.git
   cd lambda-zk/ceremony/scripts
   ```

2. **Generate your contribution**
   ```bash
   ./contribute.sh
   ```

   This script:
   - Validates the current ceremony state and PTAU integrity
   - Detects the latest verified zkey in `ceremony/output/`
   - Generates your contribution with fresh entropy
   - Creates file: `ceremony/contrib/giftcard_merkle_XXXX.zkey`
   - Displays SHA-256 checksum for verification

3. **Submit via Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b contrib-yourname
   git add ceremony/contrib/giftcard_merkle_XXXX.zkey
   git commit -m "Add entropy contribution"
   git push origin contrib-yourname
   ```

### Automated Verification

**PR Validation:**
GitHub Actions automatically validates your contribution:
- PTAU integrity verification
- Circuit compatibility check via `snarkjs zkey verify`
- Genuine entropy contribution verification
- File integrity and safety checks

**Chain Aggregation:**
Upon PR merge, the CI automatically:
- Integrates contribution into `ceremony/output/`
- Generates updated SHA-256 checksum manifests
- Maintains complete chain history
- Uploads audit logs (90-day retention)

## Finalization Phase

After sufficient contributions, the ceremony is finalized using a public randomness beacon to eliminate any remaining toxic waste.

**Final Artifacts:**
- `ceremony/output/giftcard_merkle_final.zkey` - Production proving key
- `ceremony/output/giftcard_merkle_verification_key.json` - Verification key for smart contracts

**Run finalization:**
```bash
cd ceremony/scripts
./final_beacon.sh
```

This process is typically automated through GitHub Actions for transparency.

## Auditing & Verification

Anyone can independently verify the entire ceremony:

```bash
cd ceremony/scripts

# Verify complete ceremony chain
./verify_chain.sh

# Review audit logs
ls -la ceremony_*.log

# Check checksum manifest
cat ../output/checksum_manifest.txt
```

**Verification Coverage:**
- PTAU integrity (checksum + size validation)
- R1CS circuit file integrity
- All zkey files via `snarkjs zkey verify`
- Per-contribution filename, index, and size validation
- SHA-256 checksum verification
- Audit trail consistency and temporal ordering

**Audit Logs:**
GitHub Actions generates timestamped audit artifacts containing:
- Cryptographic operation documentation (millisecond precision)
- File validation results with rejection diagnostics
- Manifest generation and verification status
- Chain consistency proofs

Example log entry:
```
2025-12-09 15:47:48 SECURITY_OK: PTAU integrity verified: e970efa7...
2025-12-09 15:47:48 VALIDATION_SUCCESS: Contribution #1 cryptographically verified
2025-12-09 15:47:48 INTEGRATION_SUCCESS: Contribution #1 integrated into ceremony chain
```

## Security Properties

### Circuit Security

**Privacy Guarantees:**
- User's `secret` and `salt` never revealed on-chain
- Merkle tree hides which commitment is being spent (anonymity set of 2^32)
- Ephemeral keys prevent address linkability between withdrawals
- Nullifiers prevent double-spending without revealing secret

**Soundness Guarantees:**
- Spending constraint enforced: `spentBefore + amountRequested <= amountDeposited` (circuits/giftcard_merkle.circom:106)
- Merkle proof ensures commitment exists in tree (circuits/giftcard_merkle.circom:125)
- Nullifier uniquely binds to withdrawal amount and secret
- BabyJubJub key derivation is cryptographically secure

### Ceremony Security

**Cryptographic Guarantees:**
- Independent entropy from each participant
- Automated validation via `snarkjs zkey verify` (300s timeout)
- Privacy-preserving: coordinators never access private entropy
- Universal trust: ≥1 honest participant ensures secure final keys
- Tamper detection via SHA-256 checksums and self-verifying manifests

**Security Architecture:**
- Multi-layered validation (cryptographic, logical, integrity checks)
- Zero-trust approach assuming potentially malicious participants
- Deterministic processing order prevents manipulation
- Full auditability through immutable Git history and timestamped logs
- Input sanitization prevents injection and path traversal attacks

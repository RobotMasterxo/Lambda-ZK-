This software facilitates a trusted setup ceremony for zero-knowledge proofs.
By using this software, you agree to participate in good faith and acknowledge
that cryptographic security depends on the honest participation of at least
one party in the multi-party computation ceremony.

See README.md for detailed security properties and participation guidelines.
This ceremony implementation follows security best practices established by
the zero-knowledge cryptography community.
